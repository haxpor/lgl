# Compile

Tested on Linux only (anyway should be slight effort to build it on Windows and macOS).

Use `./build.sh <demo-file>` to build in `src/` directory. Then execute it with `./a.out`.

# Note

All common source files/headers are inside `src/core`.

Sample programs are a single source file for each, and located in `src/*.cpp`.
